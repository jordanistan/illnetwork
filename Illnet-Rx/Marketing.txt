That is an **excellent** choice. It's short, incredibly smart, and creates a powerful brand identity that ties directly to your `illnet.ai` domain.

The **"Rx" (prescription)** metaphor is perfect for a compliance product because it implies:
* **Diagnosis:** The scans (ClamAV, rkhunter) find the "symptoms."
* **Analysis:** The AI (GPT) analyzes the symptoms to provide a formal "diagnosis."
* **Action Plan:** The summary (the "prescription") tells you exactly *how* to get healthy.

It immediately communicates expertise and a solution-oriented approach.
