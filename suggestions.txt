Based on the screenshot you provided, here is a breakdown of suggested text improvements and other ideas to enhance your site.

### More Human-Readable Text

The current text is quite technical. Here are some options to make it more engaging and benefit-focused, targeting a human user rather than just describing the function.

**1. Main Headline & Tagline**

* **Original:** "ill.network Security Scanner. A professional-grade, comprehensive security and health audit tool for Linux systems. Run it from anywhere, scan anything."
* **Suggestion A (Benefit-Focused):** "Find Linux Vulnerabilities Before They Find You. ill.network provides a professional-grade security and health audit for your systems. Run it from anywhere, get your results instantly."
* **Suggestion B (Dashboard-Focused):** "Your New Security Command Center. Run our powerful Linux scanner from your terminal and see the live results and reports appear right here."
* **Suggestion C (Simple & Direct):** "Powerful Linux Security Audits, Simplified. A comprehensive health check for your systems. Run the scan, see the results, secure your network."

**2. "Run a Scan" Instructions**

* **Original:** "To initiate a scan, run the following command in your terminal. The results will be displayed here and saved to a report file."
* **Suggestion:** "Getting started is easy. Just copy and paste this command into your terminal. Your scan results will appear live on this dashboard and be saved to a new report."

### Other Suggestions to Improve the Site

**1. Fix the "Start Scan" Button**

This is the most critical usability issue. The button says "Start Scan," but the user can't actually start a scan by clicking it—they have to go to a terminal. This is confusing.

* **Solution:** Change the button text to **"Get Started"** or **"View Instructions"**.
* **Action:** Have the button smoothly scroll the user down to the "Run a Scan" section.

**2. Clarify That This is a Dashboard**

Your UI's biggest strength is that it's a *dashboard* for viewing results, not just a command-line tool. You should emphasize this immediately.

* **How:** Add a line of text directly under the "Start Scan" (or "Get Started") button, like:
    *"Run our scanner from your terminal and watch the results appear live in your browser."*

**3. Rethink the "ill.network" Branding**

The name "ill" combined with the dark, glowing, "hacker-style" aesthetic might be a bit confusing for a "professional-grade" security tool.

* "ill" can imply sickness, which is a mixed message for a "health audit" tool.
* The theme looks cool, but it might not inspire trust for a corporate or professional user who is security-conscious.
* **Suggestion:** If your target is professional IT, consider a cleaner, more modern (but still dark-themed) UI. Reducing the intense glow effect on the text ("Run a Scan") will also improve readability and accessibility.

**4. Expand on "Scan Reports"**

The "Scan Reports" title is at the bottom, but it's likely one of the most important features for a user. It's the permanent value your tool provides.

* **Suggestion:** Add a small descriptive paragraph under the "Scan Reports" title, even before the user has any reports.
* **Example Text:** "Dive deep into your scan history. Our reports provide detailed breakdowns of vulnerabilities, track security changes over time, and offer actionable advice to help you secure your systems."
